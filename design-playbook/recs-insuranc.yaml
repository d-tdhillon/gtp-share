      - Load bordereaux data for delegated authority (DA) and binder business as matching data.
      - Match policy-level items to GL summary balances using custom attributes.
      - Track ageing, overdue balances, and broker/coverholder-level reconciliations.

      - Support rule-based auto-match for predictable fee/commission charges.
      - Track differences caused by timing or FX movements.
      - Enforce dual sign-off for syndicate-level recharges.

    desc: Manage high-volume reconciliations for DA business.
    notes:
      - Load coverholder bordereaux (premium, claims, risk) into ARCS.

      - Apply tolerances for timing differences in DA reporting.
      - Track exception items requiring coverholder clarification.

  - text: Bank & Cash Reconciliations for Premium & Claims

      - Use Transaction Matching rules for bank-to-GL reconciliation.
      - Configure auto-match for standard premium receipts and claim payments.
      - Track unmatched cash and suspense accounts.
      - Provide exception workflows for investigatory follow-up.

  - text: Solvency II & Technical Provisions Support
    icon: safety_check
    desc: Align reconciliations with SII technical provision processes.
    notes:
      - Reconcile actuarial reserves (best estimate liability, risk margin) to GL.
      - Maintain documentation for methodology changes and actuarial assumptions.
      - Track differences between actuarial, TAO, and GL valuations.
      - Support data lineage for QRT, QMA, and SII submissions.

  - text: High-Volume Matching & Performance
    icon: speed
    desc: Optimize performance for insurance datasets.
    notes:
      - Partition large bordereaux or claims files into incremental loads.
      - Run matching rules in batches to avoid performance bottlenecks.
      - Archive old periods to improve runtime.
      - Monitor match-rate KPIs to refine rules and tolerances.

  - text: Controls, Audit & Evidence Requirements
    icon: rule
    desc: Maintain strong governance aligned with insurance and Lloyd’s regulatory expectations.
    notes:
      - Require attachments for actuarial sign-offs, bordereaux approvals, and reinsurer statements.
      - Maintain full workflow history for audit trails.
      - Track aged unmatched items and escalate via dashboards.
      - Ensure consistency with internal control frameworks (SOX, Lloyd’s MS2/MS8).
