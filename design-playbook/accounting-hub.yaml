title: Accounting Hub Enablement for Insurance Subledger
sub-title: How Oracle Accounting Hub (AHCS) is configured and deployed to support a dedicated Insurance Subledger
objList:
  - text: AHCS Architecture & Deployment Model
    icon: architecture
    desc: Stand up AHCS as the accounting engine for insurance premium, claims, and reinsurance events.
    notes:
      - Deploy AHCS as the central accounting rules engine for insurance transactions.
      - Maintain the insurance subledger outside Fusion GL while AHCS transforms events into accounting entries.
      - Support multi-book (statutory, management, Lloyd’s, Solvency II) accounting in parallel.
      - Ensure all subledger events pass through AHCS before summarised posting to GL.

  - text: Source System Event Design
    icon: event
    desc: Define the granular insurance ‘events’ that AHCS will consume and convert into accounting.
    notes:
      - Premium events - written, endorsed, earned, cancelled, reinstated.
      - Claims events - FNOL, reserve set, reserve change, payment, recovery, salvage/subrogation.
      - Reinsurance events - cession, premium payable, recovery received, reinstatement premium.
      - DA/Lloyd’s events - TAO, ECOT/EBOT, DXC settlement events, binder bordereaux transactions.

  - text: Accounting Rule Configuration (AFR/ADR)
    icon: rule
    desc: Use Accounting Rules Framework (AFR) and Accounting Derivation Rules (ADR) to translate insurance data into GL entries.
    notes:
      - Map event types to specific accounting rules - debit/credit patterns per insurance event.
      - Use ADR to derive GL segments (entity, product, LoB, YOA/AY, currency).
      - Handle multi-layer reinsurance accounting using rule-based logic.
      - Allow separate rule sets for IFRS, US GAAP, Lloyd’s, and Solvency II views.

  - text: Mapping Sets, CVRs & COA Integration
    icon: view_list
    desc: Ensure insurance attributes map to valid Chart of Accounts (COA) combinations.
    notes:
      - Configure mapping sets for LoB, broker, treaty, binder, product, UMR, YOA/AY.
      - Enforce CVRs to prevent invalid combinations from being posted to GL.
      - Use AHCS to harmonise different upstream systems (claims, policy, reinsurance).
      - Integrate with EDMCS for COA and dimension governance.

  - text: Transformation & Standardisation Layer
    icon: sync_alt
    desc: Provide a standardised AHCS layer to convert raw insurance events into consistent financial events.
    notes:
      - Normalise data from multiple sources (policy admin, claims, reinsurance).
      - Apply enrichment (territory, currency, LoB) before accounting.
      - Standardise DA bordereaux structures before generating accounting entries.
      - Provide a single source of truth for premium, claims, and reinsurance postings.

  - text: Multi-Ledger & Multi-GAAP Support
    icon: public
    desc: Generate multiple accounting representations from the same insurance event.
    notes:
      - Simultaneously produce statutory, management, Lloyd’s, and regulatory books.
      - Support Solvency II technical provisions and risk margin treatments.
      - Maintain separate reporting currencies (GBP, USD, EUR) via ledger groups.
      - Reconcile differences using AHCS multi-book reporting tools.

  - text: Posting Logic & Summarisation
    icon: playlist_add
    desc: Control how subledger entries flow from AHCS to Fusion GL.
    notes:
      - Summarise transaction-level subledger data into GL posting groups.
      - Maintain detailed audit trail within AHCS while keeping GL lean.
      - Control posting frequency - real-time, daily, or period-end.
      - Separate insurance postings from operational subledgers (AP/AR/FA).

  - text: Reconciliation & Financial Close Support
    icon: checklist
    desc: Integrate AHCS with ARCS, Close Manager, and FDW for clean period-end.
    notes:
      - Reconcile AHCS subledger totals with GL balances.
      - Maintain drillback capability from GL to insurance source events.
      - Include AHCS posting controls in Close Manager tasks.
      - Feed reconciled balances into FCCS for consolidation and SII reporting.

  - text: AHCS + OIC Integration Flow
    icon: cloud_sync
    desc: Use OIC as the integration layer connecting upstream insurance systems to AHCS.
    notes:
      - OIC pulls events from policy, claims, reinsurance, DA platforms.
      - Transform and validate data before loading into AHCS subledger tables.
      - Manage retry logic, file chunking, and high-volume processing for bordereaux.
      - Use OIC to orchestrate multi-step accounting flows (event → AHCS → GL → FCCS).

  - text: Audit, Controls & Governance
    icon: verified_user
    desc: Strengthen financial control by using AHCS as the authoritative accounting engine.
    notes:
      - Maintain rule versioning for every accounting policy change.
      - Provide evidence for external audit (Lloyd’s, SII, IFRS, statutory).
      - Enforce workflow for rule deployments and mapping updates.
      - Log every accounting transformation for audit trail completeness.

  - text: Performance, Scale & High-Volume Insurance Processing
    icon: speed
    desc: Design AHCS to support millions of insurance events per period.
    notes:
      - Partition AHCS staging/subledger tables for high-volume bordereaux.
      - Optimise accounting rules for minimal latency.
      - Run multi-threaded accounting creation jobs for peak CAT or renewal periods.
      - Auto-archive old insurance event data without losing auditability.
