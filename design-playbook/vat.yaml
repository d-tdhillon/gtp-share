sub-title: Key considerations for VAT setup, compliance, reporting, and cross-jurisdiction handling in Oracle Fusion and insurance environments
objList:
  - text: VAT Framework & Country Configuration
    icon: public
    desc: Establish VAT rules, jurisdictions, and tax authorities across operating regions.
    notes:
      - Define VAT jurisdictions, tax regimes, and rates for each country.
      - Maintain standard, reduced, zero, exempt, and reverse-charge rates.
      - Configure EU-specific rules - triangulation, intra-EU supply, distance selling.
      - Maintain periodic rate updates and change-control governance.

  - text: VAT on Services vs Goods
    icon: gavel
    desc: Separate VAT treatment based on supply type and cross-border rules.
    notes:
      - Services follow “place of supply” rules; goods follow “place of delivery.”
      - For B2B cross-border services, apply reverse charge where required.
      - Insurance services often exempt — validate impacts on input VAT recovery.
      - Manage mixed-supply rules where insurance commissions include taxable elements.

  - text: VAT Determination in ERP (AP/AR)
    icon: sync_alt
    desc: Configure tax engines to automatically determine VAT during invoice processing.
    notes:
      - Use Tax Classification Codes (TCC) and Tax Rules in Oracle.
      - Automate VAT based on supplier, item, location, and transaction type.

    icon: business
    desc: Support VAT complexity across claims, commissions, brokers, reinsurers, and DA business.

      - Claims services (adjusters, lawyers, medical) generally attract VAT; claims payouts do not.
      - Broker commissions may be exempt or partially taxable depending on jurisdiction.
      - Reinsurance is generally exempt but must be validated country by country.
      - DA/coverholder fees, third-party administrator fees may attract VAT or local equivalents (GST).

  - text: VAT Recovery & Partial Exemption
    icon: balance
    desc: Manage ability to reclaim input VAT, especially in insurance where many outputs are exempt.
    notes:
      - Calculate recoverable % using partial exemption or pro-rata methods.
      - Maintain separate buckets for recoverable, non-recoverable, and restricted input VAT.
      - Automate adjustments at period-end in GL/AP.
      - Produce documentation required by tax authorities for partial exemption calculations.

  - text: VAT on Intercompany Transactions
    icon: compare_arrows
    desc: Handle VAT correctly for cross-entity services and charges.
    notes:
      - Apply local VAT based on legal entity and “place of supply.”
      - Recognise reverse charge for EU and non-EU cross-border services.
      - Validate VAT override rules for cost allocations and shared service charges.
      - Ensure IC VAT recharges reconcile to AP/AR and tax reporting.

    desc: Produce VAT returns, SAF-T, real-time reporting and electronic submissions.

  - text: VAT on Claims & Recoveries
    icon: receipt_long
    desc: Manage VAT on claims expenses, recoveries, salvage, and subrogation.
    notes:
      - Track VAT on repair services, legal fees, medical invoices, and adjuster costs.
      - Ensure recoveries incorporate VAT where taxable.
      - Identify VAT components on salvage recoveries.
      - Reconcile claims VAT to AP, GL, and subledger claims data.

  - text: VAT Determination for Delegated Authority (DA) Bordereaux
    icon: table_view
    desc: Handle VAT on DA premium/claims bordereaux across multiple countries.
    notes:
      - Apply VAT rules based on binder, territory, coverage, and risk location.
      - Manage VAT on TPA fees, handling charges, and commissions.
