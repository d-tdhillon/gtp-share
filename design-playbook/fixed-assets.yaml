sub-title: Key considerations for designing, configuring, and governing Fixed Assets (FA) in Oracle Fusion
objList:
  - text: Asset Structure & Governance
    icon: account_tree
    desc: Establish clear rules for asset creation, tracking, and end-to-end lifecycle governance.
    notes:
      - Define asset books (corporate, tax, statutory) and assign responsible owners.
      - Align asset categories, location codes, and depreciation rules to COA design.
      - Use EDMCS to govern FA segment values and reporting hierarchies.
      - Establish policies for asset additions, retirements, transfers, and adjustments.

  - text: Asset Books, Categories & Key Flexfields
    icon: view_list
    desc: Configure the FA structure to ensure proper accounting and reporting.
    notes:
      - Define category structures by asset type (IT, furniture, leasehold improvements, vehicles, etc.).
      - Configure corporate vs tax books with different depreciation methods.
      - Use descriptive flexfields (DFFs) for insurance-specific needs (project, claim, location, insurer asset ref).
      - Validate mapping of asset category to GL accounts and SLA rules.

  - text: Capitalisation & Project Integration
    icon: home_repair_service
    desc: Enable seamless flow from Projects/Procurement to Fixed Assets.
    notes:
      - Integrate with Oracle Projects for capital WIP tracking and CIP-to-asset transfers.
      - Automate capitalisation via PO receipts, AP invoices, or Project costs.
      - Enforce rules for partial capitalisation and multi-asset splits.
      - Maintain audit trails for cost adjustments and reclassifications.

  - text: Depreciation Methods & Accounting
    icon: calculate
    desc: Configure depreciation rules consistent with accounting policy.
    notes:
      - Support straight-line, declining balance, units-of-production, and custom methods.
      - Configure prorate calendars and convention rules (mid-month, mid-quarter).
      - Manage impairments, revaluations, and accelerated depreciation.
      - Align depreciation postings with ledger currency and translation rules.

  - text: Asset Tracking, Tagging & Location Controls
    icon: place
    desc: Ensure physical tracking and compliance with operational processes.
    notes:
      - Use asset tags and location tracking for moveable assets.
      - Set up location hierarchies and periodic asset verification cycles.
      - Enable barcode/RFID or inventory tools for physical counts.
      - Integrate with Facilities/ITSM systems for change-of-location controls.

  - text: Leased Assets (IFRS16 / ASC842)
    icon: receipt_long
    desc: Manage right-of-use asset accounting for leased properties and equipment.
    notes:
      - Integrate with Oracle Lease Accounting or maintain manual entries if not in scope.
      - Configure ROU asset creation, amortisation schedules, and lease liability split.
      - Support remeasurement events (renewals, terminations, modifications).
      - Reconcile lease payment schedules to AP and GL.

  - text: Asset Retirement, Disposal & Gain/Loss
    icon: delete
    desc: Ensure accurate financial treatment of retirements and disposals.
    notes:
      - Automate retirement accounting including accumulated depreciation removal.
      - Support partial retirements and multi-asset disposals.
      - Track salvage value, net book value, and gain/loss calculations.
      - Ensure links to insurance claims for damaged/lost assets where applicable.

  - text: Reconciliation & Controls
    icon: rule
    desc: Maintain strong governance across FA balances and GL activity.
    notes:
      - Reconcile FA subledger to GL using ARCS and Close Manager tasks.
      - Track unposted depreciation, pending transactions, and capital WIP balances.
      - Enforce workflow approval for adjustments and retirements.
      - Control manual journals to FA-related accounts using GL policies.

  - text: Reporting, Analytics & Compliance
    icon: insights
    desc: Enable internal, statutory, and management reporting for assets.
    notes:
      - Use FA OTBI subject areas for operational reporting (additions, disposals, depreciation).
      - Use BIP for statutory fixed asset registers and audit-ready reporting.
      - Integrate with OAC/ADW for long-term trend analysis and CAPEX dashboards.
      - Support tax and statutory reporting differences via alternate books.

  - text: Multi-Currency, FX & Global Operations
    icon: public
    desc: Ensure correct handling of multi-currency and global asset operations.
    notes:
      - Maintain asset cost in functional currency while supporting reporting currencies.
      - Validate FX impacts on depreciation for foreign currency additions.
      - Reconcile translation adjustments (CTA) for fixed asset balances.
      - Standardise policies for global entities with differing asset rules.

  - text: Performance, Volume & High-Throughput Processing
    icon: speed
    desc: Scale FA processes to support large enterprise and insurance environments.
    notes:
      - Optimise depreciation runs during off-peak hours.
      - Automate mass additions from AP/Projects to reduce manual effort.
      - Archive old books/periods to improve performance.
      - Support bulk reclassifications, mergers, and reorganisations efficiently.
