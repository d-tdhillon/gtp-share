title: Oracle Fusion Projects Subledger Considerations
sub-title: Key considerations for designing, configuring, and governing Oracle Projects as a subledger to GL
objList:
  - text: Project Structure & Governance
    icon: account_tree
    desc: Establish consistent, governed project structures aligned with enterprise policy.
    notes:
      - Define project templates, types, and classifications (capital, operating, regulatory).
      - Use project attributes such as business unit, project org, sponsor, and funding source.
      - Govern project creation, change control, and closure via workflow.
      - Align project structures with COA segments and EDMCS hierarchy rules.

  - text: Task Design & Granularity
    icon: view_list
    desc: Structure tasks to support reporting, costing, billing, and capitalisation.
    notes:
      - Define task levels (summary vs detail) and restrict unnecessary granularity.
      - Enable task-level budgeting, costing, and billing rules.
      - Use consistent naming conventions across business units.
      - Map tasks to appropriate expenditure types and financial categories.

  - text: Cost Collection & Processing
    icon: receipt_long
    desc: Track project costs from AP, Procurement, Payroll, Inventory, and external systems.
    notes:
      - Integrate AP invoices, expense claims, and timesheets automatically.
      - Support procurement cost flow (PO → Receipt → AP Invoice → Project cost).
      - Capture payroll/labour costs using time cards or external HR integrations.
      - Configure cost distribution, burdening, and cost adjustment rules.

  - text: Capital Projects & Asset Capitalisation
    icon: home_repair_service
    desc: Support CIP (Construction in Progress), capitalisation, and FA integration.
    notes:
      - Track all capital WIP costs until asset readiness.
      - Automate asset creation via Mass Capitalisation from Projects to Fixed Assets.
      - Support partial capitalisation, multi-asset splits, and retirement of CIP assets.
      - Maintain reconciliation of CIP balances with FA and GL.

  - text: Project Billing & Revenue Recognition
    icon: payments
    desc: Manage contract-based billing and revenue for internal and external projects.
    notes:
      - Configure contract types- T&M, fixed price, milestone, cost-plus.
      - Define revenue recognition methods aligned with policy (percent complete, event-based).
      - Automate invoice generation and transfer to AR.
      - Track unbilled/unearned revenue and reconcile with GL.

  - text: Funding, Grants & Multi-Sponsor Projects
    icon: account_balance_wallet
    desc: Manage complex funding across internal, external, or regulatory sources.
    notes:
      - Configure billing controls, funding limits, and cost ceilings.
      - Track cost sharing, co-financing, and sponsor-specific restrictions.
      - Support conditional funding (regulatory, IFRS17 compliance, technology upgrades).
      - Provide audit trail for each funding source.

  - text: Integration with Procurement, AP & Inventory
    icon: shopping_cart
    desc: Ensure end-to-end flow of project-related procurement and vendor costs.
    notes:
      - Map procurement categories to project expenditure types.
      - Automate accruals and chargeable cost capture.
      - Track inventory issues to projects for materials and equipment.
      - Ensure 3-way match exceptions flow correctly into project costing.

  - text: Insurance-Specific Project Use Cases
    icon: business
    desc: Support insurance transformation, technology, and catastrophe operations.
    notes:
      - Track costs for policy administration system migrations or claims modernisation.
      - Allocate costs to LOB, YOA/AY, entities, or strategic programmes.
      - Capture CAT event project costs (temporary offices, systems, surge staffing).
      - Support regulatory compliance projects (IFRS17, Solvency II, Lloyd’s reforms).

  - text: Subledger Accounting (SLA) Configuration
    icon: sync_alt
    desc: Ensure project costs and revenue are accounted correctly in GL.
    notes:
      - Map expenditure types to natural accounts, cost centres, and asset accounts.
      - Configure capital vs expense accounting through SLA rules.
      - Validate FX impacts on project costs and revenue.
      - Align project accounting with ledger settings (calendar, currency, COA).

  - text: Budgeting, Forecasting & Controls
    icon: rule
    desc: Establish strong financial controls around project spend.
    notes:
      - Enable budgetary control at project or task level.
      - Integrate with EPM for rolling forecasts and multi-year CAPEX planning.
      - Track budget vs actuals and enforce cost ceilings.
      - Require approval workflows for budget changes or transfers.

  - text: Multi-Currency, Global Projects & FX
    icon: public
    desc: Ensure correct handling of foreign currency transactions and global funding.
    notes:
      - Track project costs in transaction currency, project currency, and ledger currency.
      - Manage FX gains/losses for cross-border projects.
      - Support multi-entity project costing and intercompany allocations.
      - Align translation and remeasurement rules with GL and EPM.

  - text: Reporting & Analytics
    icon: insights
    desc: Provide detailed project visibility for Finance, PMO, and business teams.
    notes:
      - Use OTBI, Project Performance Reporting (PPR), and BI Publisher for project insights.
      - Enable dashboards for cost, schedule, revenue, billing, and variances.
      - Integrate with OAC/ADW for long-term analytics and programme reporting.
      - Provide drilldown from GL → Project → Task → Transaction.

  - text: Close, Reconciliation & Audit Trail
    icon: checklist
    desc: Ensure accurate period close across Projects, GL, AP, and FA.
    notes:
      - Reconcile project costs, CIP, and billed balances in ARCS.
      - Track unprocessed costs, pending transfers, and unbilled revenue.
      - Lock projects and tasks after close to prevent late adjustments.
      - Maintain audit trail of cost adjustments, SLA postings, and billing events.

  - text: Performance, Volume & Automation
    icon: speed
    desc: Optimise project processes for high-volume environments.
    notes:
      - Schedule cost distribution and asset capitalisation during off-peak times.
      - Use FBDI and REST APIs for bulk project or cost uploads.
      - Automate recurring project expenses and standard cost allocations.
      - Enable workflow automation for approvals and cost adjustments.
