sub-title: "Key Considerations for Implementing a Global Template for a Chicago-Based US Team"

objList:
  - text: US GAAP & Regulatory Alignment
    icon: balance
    desc: Ensure the global template accommodates US accounting, tax and compliance requirements.
    notes:
      - Incorporate US GAAP differences where global design defaults to IFRS or other standards.
      - Include US federal, state and local tax handling such as sales tax, use tax and property tax.
      - Ensure 1099/W-9 compliance within AP supplier onboarding and payment processing.
      - Embed SOX controls, evidence capture and audit traceability across key modules.

  - text: Local Operating Model & Chicago Team Structure
    icon: groups
    desc: Align the global process design with the organisational setup and responsibilities of the Chicago-based team.
    notes:
      - Identify central vs local execution responsibilities for P2P, O2C, R2R and reporting.
      - Ensure super-user, controller and finance operations roles are clearly defined for the US.
      - Tailor change management to Chicago team expectations of clarity, speed and direct communication.
      - Account for shared services or hub-and-spoke models if Chicago oversees other US regions.

  - text: Multi-Entity, Multi-State & Regional Processes
    icon: domain
    desc: Adapt the global template to the complexity of US multi-state operations.
    notes:
      - Support reporting and allocation structures for state-specific cost centres or business units.
      - Align intercompany, tax and ledger structures to US legal entities.
      - Reflect US-based operational nuances such as local approvals, procurement rules and cash processes.
      - Incorporate state-level compliance requirements into design where needed.

  - text: Tax, Withholding & 1099 Reporting
    icon: receipt_long
    desc: Ensure the global template supports US indirect taxes and vendor reporting obligations.
    notes:
      - Configure supplier tax attributes including TIN validation and withholding rules.
      - Ensure AP processes support 1099 reporting, forms generation and IRS compliance.
      - Include state-by-state sales and use tax workflows if not using an external tax engine.
      - Confirm alignment with global tax models without compromising US obligations.

  - text: Banking, Payments & US Financial Integrations

      - Configure bank statement formats and reconciliation rules suitable for US treasury operations.
      - Validate prenote processes, positive pay and NACHA-specific requirements.

  - text: Procurement & Supplier Management Localisation

    notes:
      - Incorporate strong segregation of duties, workflow approvals and evidence controls.
      - Ensure the Chicago team can meet Day 3–5 US close deadlines within the global calendar.
      - Integrate ARCS, Close Manager and automated reconciliations tailored to US workflows.
      - Provide clear audit trails for journals, approvals and configuration changes.

  - text: Data Migration & Cutover Planning
    icon: sync_alt
    desc: Ensure data migration aligns with US systems, calendars and compliance needs.
    notes:
      - Map legacy US chart of accounts, customers, suppliers and assets into the global template.
      - Address additional data attributes required for US regulatory or tax reporting.
      - Avoid cutover during Q1 SEC reporting season, US fiscal year-end or audit peaks.
      - Account for multi-state data quality issues and legacy system fragmentation.

  - text: US Integrations & Third-Party Platforms
    icon: cloud_sync
    desc: Validate and integrate US-specific third-party systems into the global template.

    notes:
      - Provide clear and concise documentation with strong ownership visibility.
      - Deliver training sessions in US time zones aligned with Chicago work schedules.
      - Use scenario-based training reflecting US processes, regulatory needs and edge cases.
      - Engage Chicago leadership early to reinforce the global template philosophy.

      - Structure sprints, UAT cycles and cutover rehearsals around CST/CDT availability.
      - Schedule hypercare coverage to include US business hours for initial stabilisation.
      - Ensure daily stand-ups and decision forums accommodate time zone overlap.
