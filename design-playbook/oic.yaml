      - Use Oracle Narrative Reporting (NR) for structured commentary and approvals.
      - Assign preparers, reviewers, and approvers for each commentary section.
      - Track versions, changes, and sign-offs for full auditability.
      - Integrate commentary with dynamic EPM/ERP data refreshes.

  - text: Regulatory & Statutory Reporting Packs

    notes:
      - Generate statutory FS, annual reports, regulatory filings, and disclosures.
      - Support Solvency II QRT, NST, SFCR/RSR final outputs.
      - Enable Lloyd’s QMA, QSR, SBF, and GQD alignment for market entities.
      - Maintain version-control and evidence for regulatory sign-off.

  - text: Management & Board Reporting

      - Apply governance for final approvals and distribution.

  - text: Disclosure Management & Audit Trail
    icon: verified_user
    desc: Maintain full traceability from source numbers to published reporting.
    notes:
      - Link disclosures directly to data cells in EPM and ERP for dynamic integrity.
      - Maintain mapping rules for footnotes, adjustments, and narrative commentary.
      - Keep historical versions with timestamped evidence for external audit.
      - Support tagging for XBRL/iXBRL as required.

  - text: Financial Close Integration
    icon: schedule
    desc: Ensure last-mile reporting follows the close calendar and certification deadlines.
    notes:
      - Integrate with Close Manager for sequencing commentary and report generation.
      - Validate that all upstream reconciliations (ARCS, subledger finalisation) are complete.
      - Lock data progressively as each close milestone is met.
      - Provide “late adjustment impacts” reporting for controllers.

  - text: Cross-System Data Orchestration (ERP → EPM → NR)
    icon: sync_alt
    desc: Ensure data flows smoothly with no latency or manual intervention.
    notes:
      - Use OIC to automate data loads into EPM and Narrative Reporting.
      - Refresh embedded report objects and commentary sections with dynamic data.
      - Schedule automated refresh windows during close cycles.
      - Highlight differences between refreshed and previously published numbers.

  - text: Integrated Controls & Risk Management
    icon: rule
    desc: Embed strong governance into the reporting lifecycle.
    notes:
      - Enable workflow for every narrative/text section and data point.

      - Implement certification steps for preparer → reviewer → CFO.
      - Track override approvals and late changes with full audit history.

  - text: Visualisation, Formatting & Publication

      - Support multiple outputs - Board Pack, Regulatory Pack, Investor Report.
      - Embed charts, commentary, and tables linked to live data.
      - Enable automated distribution lists with secure access control.

  - text: Performance, Scalability & Multi-Entity Support

      - Handle high-volume disclosures across multiple regions or business units.
      - Optimise refresh schedules to avoid bottlenecks during peak close.

      - Support parallel report development for interim and annual cycles.

  - text: AI-Assisted Commentary & Insights
    icon: auto_awesome
    desc: Use AI to enhance narrative drafting and highlight anomalies.
