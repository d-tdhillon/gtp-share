title: Insurance Subledger Considerations
sub-title: Key considerations for designing a dedicated insurance subledger supporting premium, claims, reinsurance, and Lloyd’s market processes
objList:
  - text: Core Subledger Architecture
    icon: account_tree
    desc: Establish a dedicated, granular subledger for insurance transaction recording.
    notes:
      - Supports premium, claims, recoveries, commissions, and UPR/IBNR adjustments.
      - Maintain detailed transaction-level data before summarisation to GL/EPM.
      - Provide configurable accounting rules independent of GL/SLA.
      - Enable multi-ledger support for statutory, management, Lloyd’s, and regulatory views.

  - text: Premium Subledger Processing
    icon: attach_money
    desc: Track written, earned, unearned, and ceded premiums with full auditability.
    notes:
      - Store premium instalments, endorsements, cancellations, and adjustments.
      - Maintain mapping to LOB, product, UMR, binder, broker, and territory.
      - Support earned premium calculations and deferral rules (UPR/DPAC).
      - Integrate with policy admin systems for real-time or batch premium updates.

  - text: Claims Subledger Processing
    icon: gavel
    desc: Track claim notifications, reserves, payments, recoveries, and LAE.
    notes:
      - Capture FNOL, case reserve, and actuarial IBNR movements.
      - Track paid-to-date, salvage, subrogation, and reinsurance recoveries.
      - Maintain UCR, ULR, claim triangles, and claims-by-AY/YOA splits.
      - Integrate with claims systems for reserve updates and settlement events.

  - text: Reinsurance Subledger (Ceded & Assumed)
    icon: handshake
    desc: Manage ceded, retro, and assumed reinsurance transactions and multi-layer structures.
    notes:
      - Track treaty layers, attachment points, reinstatements, profit commissions.
      - Manage cession splits by LoB, territory, YOA/AY, section.
      - Post reinsurance payable/receivable, commissions, and recoveries to GL.
      - Integrate with technical accounting (TAO/EBOT/ECOT) for Lloyd’s syndicates.

  - text: Lloyd’s & Delegated Authority (DA) Support
    icon: corporate_fare
    desc: Provide subledger capabilities aligned with Lloyd’s market requirements.
    notes:
      - Store DA-level premium/claims bordereaux and binder structures.
      - Support syndicate → ServiceCo → Corporate Member IC flows.
      - Track YOA-level reserves, RITC adjustments, and DXC settlement mappings.
      - Reconcile Lloyd’s TAO, EBOT/ECOT, and DXC outputs at transaction level.

  - text: Multi-Dimensional Insurance Accounting
    icon: grid_view
    desc: Maintain dimensional richness required for actuarial, underwriting, and finance.
    notes:
      - Support key dimensions - entity, YOA, AY, LoB, product, treaty, broker, coverage, currency.
      - Allow mapping to EPM (FCCS, PCMCS, Planning) dimensions.
      - Maintain atomic event-level granularity with drilldown capability.
      - Automate dimension derivation based on policy, claim, or reinsurance data.

  - text: Subledger Accounting Rules & Posting to GL
    icon: sync_alt
    desc: Apply configurable accounting rules before summarisation to the General Ledger.
    notes:
      - Define event-based accounting - premium written, earned, settled, claim incurred.
      - Support management vs statutory vs regulatory accounting treatments.
      - Group summarised postings using GL segment rules, avoiding transaction-level GL load.
      - Align subledger translation/revaluation with GL multi-currency settings.

  - text: Actuarial Integration & Reserving
    icon: functions
    desc: Provide actuarial teams with consistent, reconciled subledger data.
    notes:
      - Export claims triangles, premium exposure, and AY/YOA movements.
      - Accept actuarial adjustments (IBNR, risk margin, reserve changes) for posting.
      - Maintain version-controlled reserve bases by period.
      - Align with Solvency II technical provision requirements.

  - text: Data Quality, Controls & Reconciliation
    icon: rule
    desc: Establish strong governance around insurance subledger data.
    notes:
      - Validate mandatory fields - UMR, UCR, binder, YOA, AY, LoB, broker, currency.
      - Reconcile subledger → GL → EPM using ARCS and automated checks.
      - Track unmatched items (premium, claims, recoveries, fees).
      - Maintain full audit trail for adjustments and overrides.

  - text: Multi-Currency & FX Handling
    icon: public
    desc: Support robust FX processing for global policies and claims.
    notes:
      - Store original, transaction, and reporting currency values.
      - Revalue unpaid premium, reserves, and reinsurance balances.
      - Convert claim payments using daily or spot rates.
      - Support Lloyd’s multi-currency reporting (GBP, USD, CAD, EUR).

  - text: Performance, Volume & High-Throughput Processing
    icon: speed
    desc: Handle large insurance data volumes with high-frequency updates.
    notes:
      - Support millions of bordereaux rows per period.
      - Use batch and streaming ingestion via OIC for policy/claim events.
      - Summarise or compress subledger data by dimensions for long-term storage.
      - Provide parallelisable close processes for premium earning and reserve movement.

  - text: Last Mile Reporting & Regulatory Support
    icon: description
    desc: Feed downstream reporting processes with reconciled insurance data.
    notes:
      - Enable SFCR/RSR, QRT, and Lloyd’s QMA/QSR reporting.
      - Feed profitability, underwriting, and claims dashboards.
      - Provide reconciled data for finance close, actuarial review, and ORSA.
      - Integrate with Narrative Reporting for final disclosures.
