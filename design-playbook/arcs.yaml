sub-title: Key considerations for designing, implementing, and governing Account Reconciliation Cloud Service (ARCS)
objList:
  - text: Reconciliation Strategy & Scope
    icon: checklist
    desc: Define the reconciliation framework, scope, and ownership across Finance.
    notes:
      - Identify which reconciliations will be balance-sheet, template-based, or transaction-matching.
      - Define ownership model - preparers, reviewers, approvers, controllers.
      - Prioritise high-risk, high-volume, or regulatory-sensitive accounts.
      - Standardise reconciliation frequency (monthly, quarterly, annual).

  - text: Account Segmentation & Risk Rating
    icon: flag
    desc: Classify accounts based on risk, volume, regulatory importance, and materiality.
    notes:
      - Assign risk ratings (High, Medium, Low) to drive workflow and documentation needs.
      - Segment accounts by business unit, region, entity, and process.
      - Apply rules to automate risk scores based on balance movements or history.
      - Align segmentation with internal controls and audit framework (SOX).

  - text: Formats, Profiles & Templates
    icon: view_list
    desc: Standardise reconciliation formats across account types and processes.
    notes:
      - Create reusable templates for bank recs, accruals, intercompany, suspense, and operational accounts.
      - Define profile attributes (currency, preparer group, thresholds, regulatory flags).
      - Use dynamic rules to enforce minimum documentation or variance thresholds.
      - Ensure templates align with GL, subledger, and statutory requirements.

  - text: Data Loads & Integration
    icon: cloud_sync
    desc: Automate GL balance imports and transaction-level data feeds.
    notes:
      - Integrate Fusion GL balances using Data Exchange or direct ARCS integration adapters.
      - Load subledger detail (AP, AR, FA, Projects) for transaction matching.
      - Support external data sources (bank files, bordereaux, actuarial feeds).
      - Schedule automated loads and monitor for failures or data gaps.

  - text: Transaction Matching (TM)
    icon: compare_arrows
    desc: Enable automated matching for high-volume reconciliations.
    notes:
      - Use match rules for bank extracts, subledger feeds, cash receipts, and claims payments.
      - Configure auto-match thresholds, multi-attribute matching, and tolerance rules.
      - Support 1-to-1, 1-to-many, and many-to-many matching logic.
      - Define exception workflows for unresolved or unmatched items.

  - text: Workflow, Approvals & Controls
    icon: approvals
    desc: Ensure reconciliations flow through a controlled approval process.
    notes:
      - Configure preparer → reviewer → approver workflows.
      - Enforce segregation of duties and regional/location-based approvals.
      - Automate alerts for upcoming deadlines, overdue recs, or aging exceptions.
      - Enable certification workflows for SOX and audit-critical accounts.

  - text: Policies, Supporting Evidence & Audit Trail
    icon: description
    desc: Ensure reconciliations meet internal and external audit standards.
    notes:
      - Require attachments (calculations, statements, ageing, supporting schedules).
      - Maintain full audit logs of preparer, reviewer, and approver actions.
      - Restrict deletions or changes to certified reconciliations.
      - Align documentation standards with external audit requirements.

  - text: Metrics, KPIs & Performance Monitoring
    icon: insights
    desc: Track performance and improve reconciliation efficiency.
    notes:
      - Monitor KPIs - completion rate, late reconciliations, exception ageing.
      - Use dashboards for entity-level and global visibility.
      - Track matching % for Transaction Matching processes.
      - Highlight bottlenecks, recurring exceptions, or high-risk accounts.

  - text: Integration with Close Manager & Fusion ERP
    icon: join_inner
    desc: Align reconciliation timelines with accounting close cycles.
    notes:
      - Sync ARCS deadlines with Close Manager tasks.
      - Ensure subledger close occurs before reconciliation start.
      - Link reconciliations to GL entries, journals, and transactional details.
      - Prevent period closure without reconciliation of critical accounts.

  - text: Continuous Improvement & Automation
    icon: trending_up
    desc: Increase automation, reduce manual effort, and enhance control quality.
    notes:
      - Automate preparation using pre-certified balances for low-risk accounts.
      - Use rule-based auto-certification where thresholds permit.
      - Introduce AI/ML-based anomaly detection and risk scoring for recs.
      - Periodically review profiles to retire duplicate or obsolete reconciliations.

  - text: Performance, Scalability & High-Volume Support
    icon: speed
    desc: Ensure ARCS can scale for large enterprises and high-volume matching.
    notes:
      - Optimise Transaction Matching for high-volume feeds (cash, claims, payments).
      - Schedule staggered loads for large data sets to avoid performance bottlenecks.
      - Archive older periods to improve performance.
      - Scale for multiple entities, currencies, and decentralised finance teams.
