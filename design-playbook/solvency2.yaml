title: Solvency II 
sub-title: Key considerations for data, reporting, governance, actuarial integration, and finance alignment for Solvency II (SII)
objList:
  - text: Pillar 1 – Quantitative Reporting (SCR, MCR, Balance Sheet)
    icon: calculate
    desc: Structure data, controls, and models to support Pillar 1 quantitative requirements.
    notes:
      - Maintain granular SII balance sheet by entity, LoB, and region.
      - Ensure actuarial reserving outputs (BEL, risk margin, lapse risk, CAT risk) feed ERP/EPM.
      - Calculate SCR by risk module - market, credit, underwriting, operational.
      - Validate MCR calculations and ensure mapping consistency with GL/EPM.

  - text: Pillar 2 – ORSA, Governance & Risk Framework
    icon: rule
    desc: Align enterprise risk, actuarial, and finance functions for governance and risk assessment.
    notes:
      - Maintain ORSA documentation with governance, models, and stress scenarios.
      - Enable integration between risk management and financial planning.
      - Track changes to methodologies, models, and assumptions.
      - Maintain oversight of capital, liquidity, and scenario-based solvency positions.

  - text: Pillar 3 – QRT, NST & Public Disclosure
    icon: description
    desc: Support automated SII reporting packs and regulatory submissions.
    notes:
      - Map GL + EPM data to QRT templates (S.01, S.02, S.06, S.17, S.23, S.25, S.28).
      - Support Lloyd’s-specific NST templates and QMA/QSR alignments.
      - Enable automated production of SFCR and RSR disclosures.
      - Maintain version control and signed-off reporting packs.

  - text: Data Model, Lineage & SII Reporting Structures
    icon: account_tree
    desc: Build a governed, traceable data model for SII reporting.
    notes:
      - Maintain consistent mapping - GL → EPM → actuarial → QRT.
      - Store YOA/AY, LoB, territory, treaty, and product dimensions.
      - Maintain lineage to ensure traceability from source to final QRT cell.
      - Implement baseline vs stressed scenario data structures.

  - text: Integration with Actuarial Engines
    icon: functions
    desc: Ensure robust handoffs between actuarial systems and finance platforms.
    notes:
      - Import BEL, IBNR, UPR, risk margin, and cashflow projections.
      - Align actuarial triangles with finance YOA/AY frameworks.
      - Track assumption sets, discount curves, and model versions.
      - Provide adjustments back to ERP/EPM for statutory and SII views.

  - text: Capital Management & SCR Optimisation
    icon: trending_up
    desc: Support capital planning, allocation, and optimisation processes.
    notes:
      - Link SCR drivers with business planning and strategy.
      - Factor diversification effects and correlation matrices.
      - Maintain visibility of capital by entity, region, and LoB.
      - Build scenario-based capital forecasts in EPM (severe, moderate, base).

  - text: Lloyd’s Market Solvency Requirements
    icon: corporate_fare
    desc: Extend SII framework to Lloyd’s-specific solvency rules.
    notes:
      - Map SII data to Lloyd’s CMR, QMA, QSR, SBF, and GQD.
      - Support YOA-specific technical provisions, RITC, and trust fund requirements.
      - Reconcile ECA (Economic Capital Assessment) with SCR outputs.
      - Align DXC/TAO data with SII technical provision categories.

  - text: Model Governance, Assumption Management & Validation
    icon: verified
    desc: Strong governance around models, assumptions, and documentation.
    notes:
      - Maintain a central repository for actuarial assumptions and model settings.
      - Track model changes under a formal model governance framework.
      - Perform backtesting, validation, and sensitivity analyses.
      - Provide evidence for internal and external validation cycles.

  - text: Risk, Stress & Scenario Testing
    icon: psychology
    desc: Integrate stress testing and scenario analysis into SII and ORSA processes.
    notes:
      - Run prescribed stresses - interest rate, inflation, mortality, lapse, CAT.
      - Build ad-hoc stress scenarios linked to underwriting or claims trends.
      - Feed scenario results back into capital management dashboards.
      - Maintain controlled workflows for stress-run approval and documentation.

  - text: Controls, Audit & Regulatory Compliance
    icon: rule_folder
    desc: Ensure Solvency II processes meet audit and regulator expectations.
    notes:
      - Maintain controls over SII data, transformations, and model runs.
      - Log all adjustments and overrides with justification.
      - Track changes to QRT mappings and regulatory interpretation updates.
      - Provide audit trails for all SII submissions and sign-off processes.

  - text: Automation, OIC Integration & Performance
    icon: speed
    desc: Automate SII pipelines for efficiency, scale, and accuracy.
    notes:
      - Use OIC to automate data movement between ERP, EPM, actuarial, and data marts.
      - Enable parallel processing for BEL, risk margin, and capital calculations.
      - Automate QRT/NST production and publish directly into regulatory portals.
      - Build real-time dashboards for solvency position monitoring.
