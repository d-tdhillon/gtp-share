    icon: account_tree
    description: Defines how the finance transformation was positioned, scoped, and aligned to insurance-wide outcomes.
    lessons:
      - id: LS01
        lesson: Finance Transformation was scoped too narrowly as a finance-only initiative
        root_cause: Policy, claims, and reinsurance dependencies not fully recognised
        impact: Increased manual journals and reconciliations post-go-live
        recommendation: Treat insurance FT as an end-to-end value chain transformation

      - id: LS02
        lesson: Global vs local standards were insufficiently defined upfront
        root_cause: Desire to retain flexibility for local entities
        impact: Late design changes and inconsistent reporting
        recommendation: Define non-negotiable global standards with exception governance

  - category: regulatory_and_compliance
    icon: gavel
    description: Covers regulatory, statutory, and actuarial considerations impacting finance design.
    lessons:
      - id: LS03
        lesson: Regulatory requirements were not primary design drivers
        root_cause: Compliance treated as downstream reporting activity
        impact: Retrofitting IFRS 17 and Solvency II logic increased cost and risk
        recommendation: Anchor system and process design around regulatory outcomes

  - category: data_and_migration
    icon: storage
    description: Addresses data quality, ownership, and migration challenges.
    lessons:
      - id: LS04
        lesson: Source data quality was overestimated
        root_cause: Historical reliance on manual corrections and spreadsheets
        impact: Extended migration cycles and audit challenges
        recommendation: Assign clear business ownership for data cleansing

      - id: LS05
        lesson: Data migration effort was under-scoped
        root_cause: Limited understanding of legacy data structures
        impact: Delays to testing and unstable cutover
        recommendation: Perform early data profiling and multiple dry runs

  - category: integrations
    icon: hub
    description: Focuses on integration complexity across insurance systems.
    lessons:
      - id: LS06
        lesson: Integration complexity exceeded core system complexity
        root_cause: High number of insurance-specific source systems
        impact: Reconciliation issues and delayed close
        recommendation: Treat integrations as first-class deliverables

      - id: LS07
        lesson: Reinsurance accounting complexity was underestimated
        root_cause: Bespoke treaties and timing differences
        impact: Manual postings and reconciliation backlogs
        recommendation: Design reinsurance flows with specialist input

  - category: operating_model
    icon: groups
    description: Covers people, roles, processes, and ways of working.
    lessons:
      - id: LS08
        lesson: New systems did not drive new ways of working
        root_cause: Limited process re-engineering focus
        impact: Continued reliance on Excel-based workarounds
        recommendation: Redesign end-to-end processes alongside implementation

      - id: LS09
        lesson: BAU roles and ownership were unclear post-go-live
        root_cause: Incomplete transition planning
        impact: Control gaps and duplicated effort
        recommendation: Define BAU ownership, RACI, and service model early

  - category: change_and_adoption
    icon: change_circle
    description: Relates to user adoption, training, and organisational readiness.
    lessons:
      - id: LS10
        lesson: Change fatigue reduced adoption effectiveness
        root_cause: FT delivered alongside BAU and regulatory change
        impact: Slower stabilisation and reduced confidence
        recommendation: Invest in structured change management and extended hypercare

  - category: close_controls_and_reporting
    icon: fact_check
    description: Covers close performance, controls, audit, and reporting outcomes.
    lessons:
      - id: LS11
        lesson: Faster close benefits were not immediately realised
        root_cause: Manual journals and reconciliations not eliminated
        impact: Delayed close improvements
        recommendation: Redesign close processes, not just automate them

      - id: LS12
        lesson: Legacy controls were lifted into the new environment
        root_cause: Risk aversion during design
        impact: Post-go-live audit findings
        recommendation: Redesign controls to align with automated processes

      - id: LS13
        lesson: Day-one reporting expectations were unrealistic
        root_cause: Underestimated data stabilisation period
        impact: Stakeholder dissatisfaction
        recommendation: Set expectations for phased MI maturity

  - category: governance_and_delivery
    icon: rule
    description: Addresses programme governance, decision-making, and delivery discipline.
    lessons:
      - id: LS14
        lesson: Business ownership of design decisions was insufficient
        root_cause: Over-reliance on system integrator
        impact: Misaligned outcomes and long-term dependency
        recommendation: Ensure finance retains decision accountability

      - id: LS15
        lesson: Key decisions were deferred too long
        root_cause: Desire to maintain optionality
        impact: Late rework and cost escalation
        recommendation: Enforce decision deadlines with escalation paths

  - category: cutover_and_transition
    icon: sync
    description: Covers cutover, parallel run, and transition to BAU.
    lessons:
      - id: LS16
        lesson: Cutover and parallel run effort was underestimated
        root_cause: Optimistic planning assumptions
        impact: Team overload and operational risk
        recommendation: Plan extended parallel runs with additional resourcing

  - category: benefits_realisation
    icon: trending_up
    description: Focuses on value delivery and benefits tracking.
    lessons:
      - id: LS17
        lesson: Benefits were not actively tracked
        root_cause: Delivery focus outweighed outcome focus
        impact: Reduced ROI visibility
        recommendation: Baseline and govern benefits throughout the programme

      - id: LS18
        lesson: Optimisation phase was under-funded
        root_cause: Programme closed immediately after stabilisation
        impact: Value left unrealised
        recommendation: Fund post-go-live optimisation as a formal phase
