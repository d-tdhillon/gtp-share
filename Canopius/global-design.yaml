global_design_phase:
  purpose: >
    Establish the future-state design for Finance processes, Chart of Accounts,
    data structures, technical architecture, and Oracle Fusion configuration for
    an insurance organisation. Ensure requirements are captured, validated, and
    baselined prior to build.

  approach:
    - title: "Process-First, Oracle-Aligned Design"
      icon: "settings" 
      desc: >
        The design approach begins by analysing current finance processes across
        underwriting, claims, reinsurance, billing, and reporting, and defining
        the future state using Oracle Fusion best practices while minimising
        customisations and ensuring process consistency.

    - title: "Global Template with Local Governance"
      icon: "public" 
      desc: >
        A standardised global template is defined for COA, ledgers, subledgers,
        and reporting structures, with localisation controlled through formal
        governance to maintain scalability, compliance, and consistency across
        regions and entities.

    - title: "Iterative Design and Playback Cycles"
      icon: "sync" 
      desc: >
        Requirements, designs, and prototypes are iteratively reviewed with
        stakeholders using collaborative workshops and system playbacks to
        validate understanding early and ensure alignment before build begins.

    - title: "Requirements Traceability and Baseline Control"
      icon: "fact_check" 
      desc: >
        All functional and technical requirements are captured, mapped to Oracle
        capabilities, and formally baselined to control scope and support
        traceability during configuration and testing.

    - title: "Early Technical and Data Alignment"
      icon: "architecture"
      desc: >
        Technical architecture, integration patterns, reporting structures, data
        definitions, and security models are aligned early to ensure that the
        end-to-end solution meets finance, operational, and IT requirements.

    - title: "Embedded Test Strategy Definition"
      icon: "rule"
      desc: >
        Testing considerations, including test data needs, scenario planning,
        entry/exit criteria, and test phases, are embedded in the design process
        to enable a seamless transition into SIT, UAT, and subsequent test cycles.

  deliverables:
    - title: "Global Design Blueprint"
      desc: >
        A comprehensive future-state design covering processes, data structures,
        Chart of Accounts definitions, value sets, and Oracle Fusion configuration.

    - title: "Baselined Requirements Pack"
      desc: >
        A formally signed-off set of functional and technical requirements,
        mapped to Oracle capabilities and used for configuration and testing
        traceability.

    - title: "Architecture & Environment Framework"
      desc: >
        High-level architecture diagrams, integration patterns, security model,
        and a defined base environment setup for configuration and testing.

    - title: "Data Mapping & Test Data Definition"
      desc: >
        Documented mapping of legacy data to Oracle Fusion structures and a
        fully defined set of one-month representative test data for SIT and UAT.

    - title: "High-Level Test Strategy"
      desc: >
        A strategic overview of test phases, roles, responsibilities, scenarios,
        entry/exit criteria, and defect processes to guide subsequent testing
        activities.

  outcomes:
    - title: "Future-State Solution Approval"
      icon: "thumb_up"
      desc: >
        The organisation achieves formal approval of a complete, Oracle-aligned
        future-state design ready for configuration and build.

    - title: "Validated Chart of Accounts"
      icon: "list_alt"
      desc: >
        The COA, value sets, and reporting hierarchies are fully defined, mapped,
        and validated to meet statutory, management, and operational needs.

    - title: "Requirements Ready for Build"
      icon: "assignment_turned_in"
      desc: >
        Baselined requirements provide clear scope and traceability for
        configuration, reducing delivery risk and ensuring alignment across teams.

    - title: "Technical Architecture Clarity"
      icon: "account_tree"
      desc: >
        The programme has a clearly defined architecture covering integrations,
        security, reporting, environments, and data flows to support implementation.
